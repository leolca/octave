## Compute the 2-norm of a digital filter defined by the numerator coefficients, 
## @var{b}, and the denominator coefficients, @var{a}. It is also possible to 
## compute the infinity-norm by passing inf in the @var{pnorm} parameter. 
## @var{pnorm} only accepts 2 or inf.
##
## Example:
## @example
## [b, a] = butter (8, 0.5);
## filternorm (b, a)
## @end example
## @end deftypefn
